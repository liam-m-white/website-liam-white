  title: My plans
  description: >
    My plan is to eventually use this website to showcase any projects I have
    worked on, and to use it as a professional blog. For now though, it's going
    to look like a bit of a mess!

        if you roast your own beans or just bought your first french press,

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
